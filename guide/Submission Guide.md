From most to least

1) Anime OP's, ED's, Character Songs

## What's not acceptable?

* Overly long songs, under 6mins is preferred.
* Album dumps, we are looking for the best songs not more songs. Quality over quantity.

## How should my submission be formatted?

Like so! Note the double line spacing and English song titles.
